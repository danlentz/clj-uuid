<h2> Note: java.nio.ByteBuffer / java.nio.ByteOrder </h2>

If all you want to know is how to read a stream of bytes where you
<strong>know</strong> the endianness, then take a close look at
java.nio.ByteOrder and java.nio.ByteBuffer and it's order() methods,
as well as it's get and put methods.  If you want to roll your own
and/or want to know how it works, read on.

<h2> So what's up with unsigned types in Java? </h2>

    In languages like C and C++, there exist a variety of sizes of
    integers, char, short, int, long.  (char isn't really an integer,
    but you can use it like an integer and most people use it in C for
    really small integers.)  On most 32 bit systems, these correspond
    to 1 byte, 2 byte, 4 byte, and 8 byte numbers.  But note, do not
    make the mistake of assuming this is true everywhere.  On the
    other hand, Java, since it is designed to be a portable platform,
    guarantees that no matter what platform you are running on, a
    'byte' is 1 byte, a 'short' is 2 bytes, an 'int' is 4 bytes, and a
    'long' is 8 bytes.  However, C also provides 'unsigned' types of
    each of its integers, which <a href=#why_no_unsigned_types>Java
    does not</a>.  I find it incredibly annoying that Java doesn't
    deal with unsigned types, considering the huge number of hardware
    interfaces, network protocols, and file formats that use them.


<p>

    (The only exception is that Java does provide the 'char' type,
    which is a 2 byte representation of unicode, instead of the C
    'char' type, which is 1 byte ASCII.  Java's 'char' also can be
    used as an unsigned short, i.e. it represents numbers from 0 up to
    2^16.  The only gotchas are, weird things will happen if you try
    to assign it to a short, and if you try to print it, you'll get
    the unicode character it represents, instead of the integer value.
    If you need to print the value of a char, cast it to int first.)

<h2> So how do we work around this lack of unsigned types? </h2>

    Well, you're probably not going to like this... 
<p>

    The answer is, you use the signed types that are larger than the
    original unsigned type.  I.e. use a short to hold an unsigned
    byte, use a long to hold an unsigned int.  (And use a char to hold
    an unsigned short.)  Yeah, this kinda sucks because now you're
    using twice as much memory, but there really is no other solution.
    (Also bear in mind, access to longs is not guaranteed to be atomic
    - although if you're using multiple threads, you really should be
    using synchronization anyway.)

<h2> So... </h2>
<h3> Have you noticed that you seem to have this bad habit of starting your headings with "So"?</h3>
Hmm, good point.  So let's stop doing that.

<h2> How do we get the values into and out of 'unsigned' form? </h2>
<p>

    If someone sends you a bunch of bytes over the network (or you
    read them from a file on the disk, or whatever) that include some
    unsigned numbers, you need to do a few gymnastics to convert them
    into the larger java types. 


<p> 
      
    One issue that I really need to go into here is <a
    href=#whats_all_this_about_byte_order_or_endianness>byte order aka
    endianness</a>, but for the moment we're going to assume (or hope)
    that whatever you're trying to read is in what is referred to as
    'network byte order' aka 'big endian' aka Java's standard
    endianness.
      

<h3>Reading from network byte order</h3>

    Let us assume we're starting with a byte array, just to keep
    things simple, and we want to read an unsigned byte, then an
    unsigned short, then an unsigned int.

      <pre> 
	short anUnsignedByte = 0;
	char anUnsignedShort = 0;
	long anUnsignedInt = 0;

        int firstByte = 0;
        int secondByte = 0;
        int thirdByte = 0;
        int fourthByte = 0;

	byte buf[] = getMeSomeData();
	// Check to make sure we have enough bytes
	if(buf.length < (1 + 2 + 4)) 
	  doSomeErrorHandling();
	int index = 0;
	
        firstByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index]));
	index++;
	anUnsignedByte = (short)firstByte;

        firstByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index]));
        secondByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index+1]));
	index = index+2;
	anUnsignedShort  = (char) (firstByte << 8 | secondByte);

        firstByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index]));
        secondByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index+1]));
        thirdByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index+2]));
        fourthByte = (0x000000FF & ((int)buf[index+3]));
        index = index+4;
	anUnsignedInt  = ((long) (firstByte << 24
	                | secondByte << 16
                        | thirdByte << 8
                        | fourthByte))
                       & 0xFFFFFFFFL;
      </pre>

<p>

    OK, now that all looks a little complicated.  But really it is
    straightforward.  First off, you see a lot of 
<p>
<pre>
	0x000000FF & (int)buf[index]
</pre>
<p>
    What is going on there is that we are promoting a (signed) byte to
    int, and then doing a bitwise AND operation on it to wipe out
    everything but the first 8 bits.  Because Java treats the byte as
    signed, if its unsigned value is above > 127, the sign bit will be
    set (strictly speaking it is not "the sign bit" since numbers are
    encoded in <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">two's
    complement</a>) and it will appear to java to be negative.  When
    it gets promoted to int, bits 0 through 7 will be the same as the
    byte, and bits 8 through 31 will be set to 1.  So the bitwise AND
    with 0x000000FF clears out all of those bits.  Note that this
    could have been written more compactly as;
<p>
<pre>
	0xFF & buf[index]
</pre>
    Java assumes the leading zeros for 0xFF, and the bitwise &
    operator automatically promotes the byte to int.  But I wanted to
    be a tad more explicit about it.
<p>
    The next thing you'll see a lot of is the <<, or bitwise shift
    left operator.  It's shifting the bit patterns of the left int
    operand left by as many bits as you specify in the right operand
    So, if you have some int foo = 0x000000FF, then (foo << 8) ==
    0x0000FF00, and (foo << 16) == 0x00FF0000.
<p>
    The last piece of the puzzle is |, the bitwise OR operator.
    Assume you've loaded both bytes of an unsigned short into separate
    integers, so you have 0x00000012 and 0x00000034.  Now you shift
    one of the bytes by 8 bits to the left, so you have 0x00001200 and
    0x00000034, but you still need to stick them together.  So you
    bitwise OR them, and you have 0x00001200 | 0x00000034 =
    0x00001234.  This is then stored into Java's 'char' type.  
<p>
    That's basically it, except that in the case of the unsigned int,
    you have to now store it into the long, and you're back up against
    that sign extension problem we started with.  No problem, just
    cast your int to long, then do the bitwise AND with 0xFFFFFFFFL.
    (Note the trailing L to tell Java this is a literal of type 'long'
    integer.)


<h3>Writing to network byte order</h3>

    Lets assume now that we want to write the values we read above
    back into the same buffer, but whereas we read an unsigned byte,
    then an unsigned short, then an unsigned int, now we instead (for
    some arcane reason) want to write it out as unsigned int, unsigned
    short, unsigned byte.

      <pre>
	buf[0] = (anUnsignedInt & 0xFF000000L) >> 24;
	buf[1] = (anUnsignedInt & 0x00FF0000L) >> 16;
	buf[2] = (anUnsignedInt & 0x0000FF00L) >> 8;
	buf[3] = (anUnsignedInt & 0x000000FFL);

	buf[4] = (anUnsignedShort & 0xFF00) >> 8;
	buf[5] = (anUnsignedShort & 0x00FF);

	buf[6] = (anUnsignedByte & 0xFF);
      </pre>

    
<h2><a name=whats_all_this_about_byte_order_or_endianness>Whats all this about Byte Order? (or Endianness?)</a></h2>
<h3> What does it mean?  Why do I care? (And what about Network Order?)</h3>

For the record, Java is 'big endian' also known as 'network byte
order'.  Intel x86 processors are 'little endian'.  (Unless it's a
Java program running on an Intel chip.)  A data file created by an x86
system is <b>likely</b> but <b>not required</b> to be little endian.
A data file created by a Java program is <b>likely</b> but <b>not
required</b> to be big endian.  Any system can output data in whatever
format it wants and it's entirely possible the one you are dealing
with is being careful to write data in 'network byte order' aka 'big
endian'.

<h3> What does Byte Order / Endianness mean? </h3>

"Byte order" or "Endianness" refers to how a particular computer
architecture stores numbers in memory.  Typically a particular
computer is either "big endian" or "little endian".  (By the way,
according to Wikipedia, <a
href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness>these terms derive from a
story in Gullivers Travels.</a>)

<p>

You care about this because if you assume data is written in say, 'big
endian' format, and write your code accordingly, and it turns out the
data is in 'little endian' format, you're going to get garbage.  And
vice versa for assuming 'little endian' for data written in 'big
endian'.



<p>

Every number, whether expressed as digits, i.e. the number
500,000,007 or as bytes, i.e. the four byte integer (as hexadecimal)
0x1DCD6507, can be thought of as a string of digits.
And this string of digits can be thought of as having a starting, or
left, 'end', and a finishing, or 'right' end.  In English, the first
digit in a number is always the biggest (or most significant) digit -
i.e. the 5 in 500,000,007 actually represents the value 500,000,000.
The last digit in a number is always the littlest (or least
significant) digit - i.e. the 7 in 500,000,007 represents the value 7.

<p>

When we talk about Endianness, or byte order, we are talking about the
order in which we write down the digits.  Do we write the biggest
(most significant) digit first, and then the next biggest, etc etc,
until we reach the littlest (least significant) digit?  Or do we start
with the littlest digit first?  In English we always write the biggest
one first, hence English could be described as "big endian".  (There
<em>are</em> human languages where they do it the other way around.
My friend Raichle suggests Hebrew as an example of one such language,
but she's not really sure.)

<p> 

In the example above, the value 50,0000,007, in hexadecimal, is
0x1DCD6507.  And if we break it up into four separate bytes, the byte
values are 0x1D, 0xCD, 0x65, and 0x07.  In decimal those four bytes
are (respectively) 29, 205, 101, and 7.  The biggest byte is the first
one, 29, which represents the value 29 * 256 * 256 * 256 = 486539264.
The second biggest is the second byte, 205, which represents the value
205 * 256 * 256 = 13434880.  The third biggest byte is 101, which
represents the value 101 * 256 = 25856, and the littlest byte is 7,
which represents the value 7 * 1 = 7.  The values 486539264 + 13434880
+ 25856 + 7 = 500,000,007.

<p>

When the computer stores those four bytes into four locations in
memory, let's say into memory addresses 2056, 2057, 2058, and 2059,
the question is, what order does it store them in?  It might put 29 in
2056, 205 in 2057, 101 in 2058, and 7 in 2059, just like you'd write
down the number in English.  If it did, then we would say that
computer is "big endian".  However, a different computer architecture
might just as easily store those bytes by putting 7 in 2056, 101 in
2057, 205 in 2058, and 29 in 2059.  If the computer stored the bytes
in that manner then we would say that it was "little endian".

<p>

Note that this also applies to how the computer stores 2 byte shorts
and 8 byte longs.  Also note that the "biggest" byte is also referred
to as the "Most Significant Byte" (MSB) and the "littlest" byte is
also referred to as the "Least Significant Byte" (LSB), so you will
often times see those two phrases or acronyms popping up.

<h3> Ok, fine, so why do I care about Byte Order? </h3>

Well, it depends.  A lot of the time you don't have to.  In pure Java,
byte order is always the same no matter what platform you're on, so no
big deal, you can forget about it, as long as you're dealing with pure
Java.  

<p>

But what happens when you're dealing with data generated by other
languages?  Well, now you have to pay attention to things a bit.  You
have to make sure that you decode the bytes in the same order as they
were originally encoded in, and likewise make sure that you encode the
bytes in the same order as they will be decoded in.  If you're lucky
this will be specified somewhere in the spec or API for whatever
protocol or file format you're dealing with.  If you're
unlucky... well.  Good luck.

<p>

The biggest problem is simply remembering what your byte order is, and
knowing what the byte order of the data you are reading in is.  If
they're not the same, you need to make sure you re-order them
correctly, or in the case of dealing with unsigned numbers like above,
you need to make sure you put the correct bytes into the correct parts
of the integer/short/long.


<h3> What the heck is Network Order? </h3> 

When the Internet Protocol (IP) was designed, "big endian" byte order
was designated as "network order".  All numeric values in IP packet
headers are stored in "network order".  The byte order of the computer
creating the packets is referred to as "host order", although it may
in fact be the same as "network order" if your host is a "big endian"
machine.  So that's why you'll some times see Java endianness/byte
order referred to as "network order", since both Java byte order and
network byte order are "big endian"

<p>



<h2><a name=why_no_unsigned_types>Why no unsigned types?</a></h2>

    Why doesn't Java provide unsigned types?  Good question.  I always
    thought it was kind of strange, especially since there are lots of
    network protocols out there that use unsigned types.  I first ran into
    this back in 1999.  At the time I did a lot of digging on the web
    (google wasn't as good then as it is now) because I had a hard
    time believing this was true, but eventually I ran across an
    interview with one of the inventers of Java (was it Gosling?  I
    can't remember.  I wish I'd saved a copy of that web page). where
    the designer came right out and said something like "Hey, unsigned
    types make everything more complicated and nobody really needs
    them anyway, so we left them out."  Here's another web page with
    an interview with James Gosling that might give you an idea of
    where he's coming from:
